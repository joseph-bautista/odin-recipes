# Odin Recipes

I am currently trying out the Odin project curriculum and despite having 5 years of working experience in Software Engineering I decided not to skipp lessons and grind from scratch. I will try to create projects and never skips lessons as if I am just learning web development. So part of it is this project of creating a basic HTML web page that builds a basic recipe website.
